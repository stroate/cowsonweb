 *
 * This file contains prototype definitions for SIM API.
 *
 * A subscriber identity module or subscriber identification module (SIM) is an integrated circuit
 * that securely stores the international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) and related key used to
 * identify and authenticate subscribers on M2M devices.
 *
 * Most SIM cards can store a number of SMS messages and phone book contacts.
 *
 * @section le_sim_binding IPC interfaces binding
 *
 * All the functions of this API are provided by the @b modemService.
 *
 * Here's a code sample binding to modem services:
 * @verbatim
   bindings:
   {
      clientExe.clientComponent.le_sim -> modemService.le_sim
   }
   @endverbatim
 *
 *
 * @section le_sim_SelectCard Select a card to use
 * le_sim_SelectCard() function is used to select the SIM identifier. By default, the SIM in slot 1
 * is used.
 * Additionally, any Legato SIM API with a SIM card identifier passed in parameter, selects that
 * SIM identifier. le_sim_GetSelectedCard() returns the current selected card, not necessarily the
 * one set previously by le_sim_SelectCard().
 *
 * @note The SIM selection is not reset persistent; this function has to be called at each start-up.
 *
 * @note It is recommended to wait for a SIM handler notification after a new SIM selection before
 * calling le_sim API functions.
 *
 *
 * A sample code can be seen in the following page:
 * - @subpage c_simTestSelect
 *
 * @section le_sim_id SIM identification information
 * \b ICCID:
 * Each SIM is internationally identified by its integrated circuit card identifier (ICCID). ICCIDs
 * are stored in the SIM cards and engraved or printed on the SIM card body.
 * The ICCID is defined by the ITU-T recommendation E.118 as the
 * Primary Account Number. According to E.118, the number is up to 19 digits long, including a
 * single check digit calculated using the Luhn algorithm. However, the GSM Phase 1 (ETSI
 * Recommendation GSM 11.11) defined the ICCID length as 10 octets (20 digits) with
 * operator-specific structure.
 *
 * le_sim_GetICCID() API reads the identification number (ICCID).
 * le_sim_AddIccidChangeHandler() function registers a handler to be notified when ICCID changes.
 * le_sim_RemoveIccidChangeHandler() function unregisters the handler.
 *
 * @note During the initialization phase of the service, each new subscription to the ICCID change
 * event is notified by the last change event. This behavior lasts only for 5 seconds and allows
 * freshly registered clients to receive any ICCID changes that occured during the module start-up
 * phase.
 *
 * Using this API selects the requested SIM.
 *
 * \b IMSI:
 * The International Mobile Subscriber Identity or IMSI is a unique identification associated with
 * all cellular networks. The IMSI is used in any mobile network that connects with other
 * networks. For GSM, UMTS and LTE network, this number is provisioned in the SIM card.
 *
 * An IMSI is usually presented as a 15 digit long number, but can be shorter. The first 3 digits
 * are the mobile country code (MCC), are followed by the mobile network code (MNC), either 2
 * digits (European standard) or 3 digits (North American standard). The length of the MNC depends
 * on the value of the MCC. The remaining digits are the mobile subscription identification number
 * (MSIN) within the network's customer base.
 *
 * \b EID:
 * The EID (also called eUICCID) is the unique identifier for the embedded Universal Integrated
 * Circuit Card (eUICC).
 * A eUICC is a SIM card with a remote provisioning function, and is designed to not be removed or
 * changed. It is able to store multiple communication profiles but only one is enabled (recognized
 * by the device and used for communication). With conventional SIM cards, the ICCID is used as the
 * unique key to identify the SIM card, but with eUICC, the ICCID is the key used to identify a
 * profile, and a new identifier is defined, called the eUICCID (EID), which is used as the unique
 * key for the embedded SIM.
 * le_sim_GetEID() API reads the EID.
 *
 * \b Home \b Network \b Name:
 * le_sim_GetHomeNetworkOperator() retrieves the Home Network Name.
 *
 * le_sim_GetIMSI() API reads the international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI).
 *
 * Using this API selects the requested SIM.
 *
 * \b Phone \b Number:
 * le_sim_GetSubscriberPhoneNumber() API reads the Phone Number associated to the SIM.
 * If the phone number has not been provisioned, it will return the empty string.
 *
 * Using this API selects the requested SIM.
 *
 * \b Home \b Network \b Information:
 * - le_sim_GetHomeNetworkOperator()function retrieves the Home Network Name.
 * - le_sim_GetHomeNetworkMccMnc()function retrieves the Home Network MCC (Mobile Country Code)
 *      and MNC (Mobile Network Code).
 *
 * A sample code can be seen in the following page:
 * - @subpage c_simTestIdentification
 *
 * @section le_sim_auth SIM Authentication
 * le_sim_EnterPIN() enters the PIN (Personal Identification Number) code that's
 * required before any Mobile equipment functionality can be used.
 *
 * Using this API selects the requested SIM.
 *
 * le_sim_GetRemainingPINTries() returns the number of remaining PIN entry attempts
 * before the SIM will become blocked.
 *
 * Using this API selects the requested SIM.
 *
 * le_sim_GetRemainingPUKTries() returns the number of remaining PUK entry attempts
 * before the SIM will become blocked.
 *
 * Using this API selects the requested SIM.
 *
 * le_sim_ChangePIN() must be called to change the PIN code.
 *
 * Using this API selects the requested SIM.
 *
 *  le_sim_Lock() locks the SIM card: it enables requests for the PIN code.
 *
 * Using this API selects the requested SIM.
 *
 *  le_sim_Unlock() unlocks the SIM card: it disables requests for the PIN code.
 *
 * Using this API selects the requested SIM.
 *
 * le_sim_Unblock() unblocks the SIM card. The SIM card is blocked after X unsuccessful
 * attempts to enter the PIN. le_sim_Unblock() requires the PUK (Personal Unblocking) code
 * to set a new PIN code.
 *
 * A sample code can be seen in the following page:
 * - @subpage c_simTestAuthentication
 *
 * @section le_sim_state SIM states
 * le_sim_IsPresent() API advises the SIM is inserted (and locked) or removed.
 *
 * Using this API selects the requested SIM.
 *
 * le_sim_IsReady() API advises the SIM is ready (PIN code correctly entered
 * or not required).
 *
 * Using this API selects the requested SIM.
 *
 * The le_sim_GetState() API retrieves the SIM state:
 * - LE_SIM_INSERTED      : SIM card is inserted and locked.
 * - LE_SIM_ABSENT        : SIM card is absent.
 * - LE_SIM_READY         : SIM card is inserted and unlocked.
 * - LE_SIM_BLOCKED       : SIM card is blocked.
 * - LE_SIM_BUSY          : SIM card is busy.
 * - LE_SIM_STATE_UNKNOWN : Unknown SIM state.
 *
 * Using this API selects the requested SIM.
 *
 * A handler function must be registered to receive SIM's state notifications.
 * le_sim_AddNewStateHandler() API allows the User to register that handler.
 *
 * The handler must satisfy the following prototype:
 * typedef void(*le_sim_NewStateHandlerFunc_t)(@ref le_sim_Id_t simId, @c le_sim_States_t simState);
 *
 * When a new SIM's state is notified, the handler is called.
 *
 * Call le_sim_GetState() to retrieve the new state of the SIM.
 *
 * @note If two (or more) applications have registered a handler function for notifications, they
 * will all receive it and will be passed the same SIM.
 *
 * The application can uninstall the handler function by calling le_sim_RemoveNewStateHandler() API.
 *
 * @warning Your platform might need a reboot to detect a SIM insertion or removal.
 * Please refer to the @ref platformConstraintsSim "SIM constraints" page or your platform
 * documentation for further details.
 *
 * A sample code can be seen in the following page:
 * - @subpage c_simTestStates
 *
 * le_sim_SetPower() powers up or down the current SIM card.
 *
 * @section le_sim_profile_switch SIM profile switch
 *
 * As soon as there are several subscriptions/profiles in the eUICC (multi-profile), and one of
 * them is dedicated to emergency calls (ex: eCall, ERA-Glonass), local swap is needed to swap as
 * quickly as possible to the emergency profile in case of need.
 *
 * “Local swap” means that the User's application must be able to directly request the eUICC to
 * swap to Emergency Call Subscription (ECS).
 *
 * Local swap puts the eUICC in a temporary state, meaning the commercial subscription is replaced
 * by emergency subscription for a limited time, event triggering the swap back to commercial
 * subscription being controlled by the User's application.
 *
 * The le_sim_LocalSwapToEmergencyCallSubscription() function requests the multi-profile eUICC to
 * swap to ECS and to refresh. The User's application must wait for eUICC reboot to be finished and
 * network connection available.
 *
 * The le_sim_LocalSwapToCommercialSubscription() function requests the multi-profile eUICC to swap
 * back to commercial subscription and to refresh. The User's application must wait for eUICC reboot
 * to be finished and network connection available.
 *
 * eUICC allows support of multiple SIM profiles. These profiles can also be managed remotely from
 * a Subscription Manager Server. Changing the SIM profile remotely may impact the customer
 * application especially if there is an ongoing data transmission. To prevent any data loss,
 * switching SIM profiles is subject to a user agreement. This way, the customer application will
 * be able to properly finalize its current procedure (emergency call for instance) before accepting
 * the SIM swap.
 *
 * The application can subscribe a handler using le_sim_AddProfileUpdateHandler() to monitor SIM
 * profile change requests. Thus, the application can choose to accept or reject the SIM profile
 * swap procedure using le_sim_AcceptSimToolkitCommand() or le_sim_RejectSimToolkitCommand().
 *
 * @warning
 * If there is no subscribed handler, the SIM service automatically accepts any SIM profile swap
 * request.
 *
 * The User's application can install a handler with le_sim_AddNewStateHandler() to receive eUICC's
 * state notifications.
 *
 * @warning
 * - If you use a Morpho or Oberthur card, the SIM_REFRESH PRO-ACTIVE command must be accepted with
 *   le_sim_AcceptSimToolkitCommand() in order to complete the profile swap procedure.
 * - If you use a Giesecke & Devrient (G&D) card, be sure that your platform has disabled
 *   security restrictions for channel management APDU commands, otherwise local SIM profile switch
 *   could not work.
 *
 * The le_sim_IsEmergencyCallSubscriptionSelected() function must be called to get the current
 * subscription.
 *
 * @warning There is no standard method to interrogate the current selected subscription. The
 * returned value of this function is based on the last executed local swap command. This means
 * that this function will always return LE_NOT_FOUND error at Legato startup.
 *
 * A sample code can be seen in the following page:
 * - @subpage c_simTestProfileSwitch
 *
 * @section le_sim_Reset SIM Reset
 *
 * The le_sim_Reset() function resets the SIM card.
 *
 * @section le_sim_FPLMNList Read / Write FPLMN List from SIM
 *
 * The le_sim_CreateFPLMNList() function creates the empty FPLMN list.
 *
 * The le_sim_AddFPLMNOperator() function adds the FPLMN network into FPLMN list.
 *
 * The le_sim_WriteFPLMNList() function writes FPLMN list into the SIM.
 *
 * The le_sim_ReadFPLMNList() function reads the FPLMN list from the SIM card.
 *
 * The le_sim_GetFirstFPLMNOperator() function fetches the first FPLMN operator from FPLMN list.
 *
 * The le_sim_GetNextFPLMNOperator() function fetches the next FPLMN operator from FPLMN list.
 *
 * The le_sim_DeleteFPLMNList() function releases all allocated resources associated with the
 * List object.
 *
 * @note Some platforms do not support FPLMN APIs. Please refer to the @ref platformConstraintsSim
 * "SIM constraints" page or your platform documentation for further details.
 *
 * @section le_sim_stk SIM Toolkit
 *
 * The SIM application Toolkit allows the SIM card to initiate commands or asking input from the
 * modem to accept/reject SIM operations.
 *
 * One of the use case is the remote provisioning of an embedded UICC (eUICC): the eUICC format
 * supports multiple subscription profiles, which can be remotely provisioned, updated or selected
 * through SIM Toolkit procedures (Bearer Independent Protocol @em BIP, SIM refresh).
 *
 * It is mainly used for in-vehicle emergency call service (eCall).
 *
 * An eUICC can be remotely managed to change the Mobile Network Operator subscription.
 *
 * The le_sim_AddSimToolkitEventHandler() API registers a handler to be notified of SIM
 * Toolkit events. The le_sim_RemoveSimToolkitEventHandler() API unregisters the handler.
 *
 * The last received SIM Toolkit command can:
 * - Either be accepted by the device with the le_sim_AcceptSimToolkitCommand() API
 * - Or be rejected by the device with the le_sim_RejectSimToolkitCommand() API.
 * Note that if no handler is registered, refresh requests are automatically accepted.
 *
 * In case the last SIM Toolkit command is a Refresh command (@ref LE_SIM_REFRESH), additional
 * information can be retrieved:
 * - The le_sim_GetSimToolkitRefreshStage() API gets the stage of the Refresh command.
 * - The le_sim_GetSimToolkitRefreshMode() API gets the mode of the Refresh command, as defined in
 *   ETSI TS 102 223 sections 6.4.7 and 8.6.
 *
 * A sample code using the SIM Toolkit APIs can be seen in the following page:
 * - @subpage c_simTestSimToolkit
 *
 * Information related to SIM Toolkit platform constraints can be found in the
 * @ref platformConstraintsStk "SIM Toolkit platform constraints" page.
 *
 * @section le_sim_access SIM access
 *
 * The SIM card content can be accessed and/or modified by several methods.
 *
 * @subsection le_sim_accessApdu APDU
 *
 * The application can send an APDU (Application Protocol Data Unit) to the SIM using
 * le_sim_SendApdu() API. The user must encode the APDU as specified by in recommendation 3GPP
 * 11.11, 3GPP 51.011, 3GPP 31.102, 3GPP 31.103 or ETSI TS 102 221.
 * @note Between two successive calls to le_sim_SendApdu() API, there is no locking
 * protection. In this situation, some command types and parameters can modify SIM files
 * incorrectly.
 *
 * @subsection le_sim_accessCommand Commands
 *
 * Using le_sim_SendCommand(), the application has easier but more limited access to the
 * SIM database. The command is transmitted to the SIM, which gives information through swi1 and
 * swi2 about the execution of the command (see 3GPP recommendation previously mentioned for
 * their coding).
 * Some parameters are platform dependent, see @subpage platformConstraintsSim "SIM constraints" for
 * their coding.
 *
 * @subsection le_sim_accessLogicalChannel Logical channels
 *
 * Logical channels are specified by the standard ETSI TS 102 221 in the section 8.7. If they are
 * supported by the SIM card, logical channels allow to send independent APDUs on the different
 * channels. In this case:
 * - the basic channel 0 is always available and opened.
 * - upon request, the card assigns a number to open a new channel. This channel remains open until
 *   it is explicitly closed or the SIM card is deactivated.
 *
 * Use le_sim_OpenLogicalChannel() API to open a logical channel on the SIM card. APDUs can then
 * be sent to the SIM card with le_sim_SendApduOnChannel(). When the logical channel is not
 * needed anymore, it can be closed using le_sim_CloseLogicalChannel().
